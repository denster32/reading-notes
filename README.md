# My reading journal for Code Fellows

## **Hi my name is Dennis and I'm learning to code.  I have some coding experience but I am looking forward to becoming a software developer and look forward to a long, fruitful career.**

_Growth mindset to me means lifelong learning. We are born with innate traits but we are only limited by the roadblocks that we put up for ourselves._

**Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:**

1. _When I face a challenging problem I will embrace it rather than run from it._
2. _Throughout this bootcamp I will find myself wanting to hit the snooze button, I need to remind myself that I need to prepare for the day to set myself up for success._
3. _I will inevitably make mistakes and will need to ask for help.  I will embrace the criticism that I receive and take it as positive feedback._
