# My reading journal for Code Fellows

Hi my name is **Dennis** and I'm learning to code.  I have some coding experience but I am looking forward to becoming a software developer and look forward to a long, fruitful career.  

Growth mindset to me means lifelong learning. We are born with innate traits but we are only limited by the roadblocks that we put up for ourselves.  

Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:

1.  --When I face a challenging problem I will embrace it rather than run from it. -- 
2.  Throughout this bootcamp I will find myself wanting to hit the snooze button, I need to remind myself that I need to prepare for the day to set myself up for success. 
3.  I will inevitably make mistakes and will need to ask for help.  I will embrace the criticism that I receive and take it as positive feedback.
