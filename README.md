# My reading journal for Code Fellows

## **Hi my name is Dennis and I'm learning to code.  I have some coding experience but I am looking forward to becoming a software developer and look forward to a long, fruitful career.**

Here is a link to my github portfolio: <https://denster32.github.io/reading-notes/>

_Growth mindset to me means lifelong learning. We are born with innate traits but we are only limited by the roadblocks that we put up for ourselves._ 

**Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:**

1.  _When I face a challenging problem I will embrace it rather than run from it._
2.  _Throughout this bootcamp I will find myself wanting to hit the snooze button, I need to remind myself that I need to prepare for the day to set myself up for success._
3.  _I will inevitably make mistakes and will need to ask for help.  I will embrace the criticism that I receive and take it as positive feedback._
