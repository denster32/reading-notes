# Class 4 Notes - React and Forms

## Summary of Topics

### React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- Its a way of making the React state the single source of truth for both the mutable state and the user input

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- We should wait until they submit the form, just in case they make changes to their input

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- we are targetting the click

### The Conditional(Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

- They are a way of shortening if statements w one line of code
- Easier to read and faster to code

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

- x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
