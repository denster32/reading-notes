# Class 3 Notes - Revisions and the Cloud

## Why this topic matters?

- Local processing is important bc the the desktop tools are much more powerful than what the github website has to offer.  Cloning repositories and storing them locally becomes a prereq to use those tools.  

## Summary of topics

- Cloning a repository makes a copy of it so that you can store it on a local machine
- Local repository structure: working directory, index, head
- ACP = add, commit, push
- git status = check file status
