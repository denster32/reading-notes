### Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- inside of an <a> element

2. The href attribute contains what information?

- href attribute or hypertext reference or target contains the web address

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- screen readersneed to be taken into account bc they jump from link to link, reading out of centext at times
- search engines use link text to index target files -> good to include keywords in link text
- visual readers tend to skim webpages rather than read them -> descriptive link text is useful to grab their attention

### CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

- its the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.  when something is taken out of the flow it works independently,

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

- in normal flow: inline elements display in the inline direction ie the direction words are displayed, block elements display one after the other like paragraphs

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element. static

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

- allows you to place any page element wherever you want it

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

- absolute elements are removed from the normal flow which makes it pwoerful but can limit site flexibility.  fixed position elementsare positioned relative to the viewport which doesnt change when the window is scrolled

### Learn JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- declaring a functions defines it with specified parameters. invoking a function calls it with parameters inside paranthesis  

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- a parameter is one of the variables in a function, arguments are the data passed through the parameters when the function is called

### Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- I feel like a will struggle with the adage "two heads are better than one" vs "stop looking over my shoulder." From the six reasons for pair programming I feel that the two that I look forward to are learning from fellow students and job interview readiness.  I have always been great at solving math problems or engineering problems but when it comes to explaining how I did it I tend to stutter around and struggle with a clear concise explantion.  this is something that I need to remedy.
