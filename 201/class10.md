# Class 10 Notes - Debugging

## What Went Wrong?

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- syntax error -> spelling errors that cause program not to run or stop working
- logic error  -> code is not waht it intended to be, runs successfully but gives incorrect results

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- syntax errors - many spelling mistakes but also misspelling variable names
- many logic errors such as not getting the desired outcome with CSS or tables

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- errors will be inevitable, efficient debugging will be the key in the future in order to write code quickly that works as intended

## Javascript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- Debugging tools are meant to analyze code that youv'e written as you step through it.  they are a great tool to ensure that algorithms are running as intended and that variable vaulables are being tallied as intended

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

- breakpoints are places in your code that pause execution

3. What is the call stack?

- call stack is the section that shows the code that was previously executed to get to your current line ie all the code before a breakpoint
