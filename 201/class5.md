# Class 5 Notes - Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

- alt can be used as descriptive text for screen readers, as an accesiblity option

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

- I beleive this is a follow up to the last question, when people cant see the screen we can provide a textual explanation for them

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

- figure elements can be used to the browser that we are including information for those who cannot see the screen

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

- gif = graphics interchange format, svg = scalable vector graphics.  gif is good for simple images and animations, svg is good for user interface elements, icons and diagrams

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

- from the reading lossless WebP or PNG would be best with JPEG coming in third.  screeshots can be highly detailed so we would want a format that has less compression and higher resolution.  

## Learn CSS

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

- everyone has been to a website, the foreground color refers to the text color and background refers to the page color

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

- first we would want to choose an appropriate base color that fits the topic, then we would proceed to choose the rest of the palette.  we would want to consider what colors browsers can render.  from there we might use a third party tool to help us choose the palette.  I am not a graphic designer and do not desire to be, there is science behind using colors to make a website inviting.  

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

- we should consider which fonts are available for use on browsers, these are called web safe fonts

4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

- font size = size determined by the unit used, font weight = how bold the test is, font style = italic on or off

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

- we could use text alignment or line height to adjust spacing
